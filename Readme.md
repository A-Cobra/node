## Projects

### [Memoization](./memoization)

This project implements the Fibonacci sequence using memoization technique. It includes both recursive and iterative versions of the Fibonacci algorithm. The recursive version recursively calculates the Fibonacci numbers, while the iterative version uses a loop to compute them. The purpose of this project is to compare the performance and efficiency of the two approaches.

### [Power Consumption](./power-consumption)

This project focuses on monitoring and analyzing power consumption data. It provides a set of tools and utilities to collect power consumption data from various sources and perform analysis on the collected data. The project aims to help users (programmers and PC users) understand and optimize power consumption in their systems and applications.
